**Content Type:** experiment
**Keywords:** agent, multiple, full, clarifying, scenarios, evaluation, covering, finally, showcases, user

evaluation of DeepCode,
including comparative analysis against multiple benchmark models and reproducibility analysis across
different papers and operational scenarios. Second, theDeepCode Application Casessubsection
showcases representative visualizations demonstrating DeepCode’s end-to-end capabilities, covering
backend systems, web user interfaces, and the Paper2Code research reproduction workflow. Third, the
DeepCode Sub-Agent Detailssubsection elucidates the internal multi-agent architecture, clarifying
the roles, responsibilities, and coordination patterns for implementing specific specialized sub-agents.
Finally, theMCP Toolkit in DeepCodesubsection documents the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
tools integrated into the system, defining the external interfaces through which DeepCode interacts
with code repositories, documentation, and execution environments.
