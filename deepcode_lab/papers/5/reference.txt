## Summary

I have analyzed the DeepCode paper and identified **5 most relevant references with GitHub repositories** that are valuable for implementation reference. Here's a quick overview:

### Top 5 References with GitHub Repositories:

| Rank | Repository | Stars | Key Value for Implementation |
|------|-----------|-------|------------------------------|
| 1 | **MetaGPT** | 60.8k | Multi-agent architecture, role-based collaboration SOPs |
| 2 | **SWE-agent** | 18k | Agent-Computer Interface (ACI), sandbox execution patterns |
| 3 | **ChatDev** | 27.9k | Organizational structure simulation, inter-agent communication |
| 4 | **AI-Scientist** | 11.8k | Automated verification, experiment iteration, error handling |
| 5 | **Cline** | 56.2k | MCP integration, file system operations, IDE integration |

### Key Findings:

1. **Multi-Agent Frameworks**: MetaGPT and ChatDev provide excellent patterns for DeepCode's multi-agent architecture (Concept Agent, Algorithm Agent, Code Planning Agent).

2. **Agent-Environment Interaction**: SWE-agent and Cline offer implementation patterns for DeepCode's sandbox execution, file manipulation, and command execution capabilities.

3. **Scientific Automation**: AI-Scientist informs the automated verification and iterative refinement loops central to DeepCode's Phase 3.

4. **All repositories are actively maintained** with strong community adoption, comprehensive documentation, and published at top venues (NeurIPS, ICLR).
