Based on the context you've provided, I can see you've already done extensive analysis of the paper and identified relevant GitHub repositories. Now you want me to download the code to the specified directory. Let me first check what exists and then help organize the downloads.
[Calling tool filesystem_list_allowed_directories with args {}]
[Calling tool filesystem_create_directory with args {'path': 'C:\\Users\\wenming\\source\\repos\\DeepCode\\deepcode_lab\\papers\\4\\code_base'}]
I've created the `code_base` directory. However, I need to clarify something important:

**I cannot directly download GitHub repositories** using the filesystem tools available to me. The filesystem tools allow me to read, write, and manage local files, but they don't have the capability to clone or download repositories from GitHub.

To download these repositories, you'll need to use one of these methods:

### Option 1: Git Clone Commands (Recommended)
Run these commands in your terminal/PowerShell:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\wenming\source\repos\DeepCode\deepcode_lab\papers\4\code_base

# Top 5 Most Relevant Repositories
git clone https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent.git
git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.git
git clone https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist.git
git clone https://github.com/Md-Ashraful-Pramanik/MapCoder.git
git clone https://github.com/HKUDS/AI-Researcher.git

# Additional Relevant Repositories (Optional)
git clone https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.git
git clone https://github.com/huangd1999/AgentCoder.git
git clone https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy.git
```

### Option 2: Download as ZIP
Visit each GitHub URL and click "Code" → "Download ZIP", then extract to the `code_base` folder.

### Option 3: I can create a batch script for you

Would you like me to create a `download_repos.bat` or `download_repos.ps1` script that you can execute to clone all repositories automatically?
