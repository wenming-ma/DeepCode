## Summary

I analyzed the research paper "DeepCode: Open Agentic Coding" and identified **12 references with GitHub repositories**. From these, I selected the **top 5 most relevant** based on the evaluation criteria:

### Top 5 Selected References:

| Rank | Paper | Stars | Key Relevance |
|------|-------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | **SWE-agent** | 18K+ | Agent-Computer Interface design, sandbox execution, tool integration |
| 2 | **ChatDev** | 27.9K+ | Multi-agent organizational structure, role-based collaboration |
| 3 | **AI Scientist** | 11.8K+ | Scientific discovery automation, Paper2Code workflow |
| 4 | **MapCoder** | 180+ | Four-agent code generation pipeline, adaptive traversal |
| 5 | **AI-Researcher** | 3.8K+ | Scientific reproduction, same research group as DeepCode |

### Key Findings:

1. **SWE-agent** provides the best reference for implementing agent-environment interactions and tool interfaces, with excellent documentation and active maintenance.

2. **ChatDev** offers the most comprehensive multi-agent architecture patterns that directly influenced DeepCode's sub-agent system design.

3. **AI Scientist** and **AI-Researcher** are most relevant for the specific task of scientific paper reproduction, with AI-Researcher being from the same research group (HKUDS) as DeepCode.

4. **MapCoder** demonstrates a clean four-agent architecture that mirrors DeepCode's Blueprint→Generation→Verification pipeline.
