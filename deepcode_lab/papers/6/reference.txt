# ⚠️ INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS NOTICE

**This analysis may be incomplete** due to reaching the maximum number of tool usage iterations. To provide a more complete answer, I would have needed:

1. **More GitHub API queries** to verify specific repositories related to each of the 15 references in the paper
2. **Search access to GitHub** (blocked by robots.txt) to find implementations of specific algorithms mentioned in the references
3. **Additional repository verification** for papers like the maximum flow algorithm by Cherkassky, river routing by Hsu, and other VLSI routing works

Despite these limitations, I have analyzed the paper's references and identified repositories with relevant implementations based on my knowledge and the successful API queries.

These repositories provide implementations of the core algorithms (network flow, routing) that would be essential for reproducing or extending the paper's methodology.

## Key Findings

### Why These Repositories Were Selected:

1. **NetworkX** - Directly implements the Cherkassky maximum flow algorithm (Reference [5]) which is the core of the paper's global routing approach

2. **Google OR-Tools** - Production-quality MCMF solver essential for the wire-bonding pad to bump pad assignment problem

3. **OpenROAD** - Modern open-source EDA tool that implements similar two-phase (global + detailed) routing methodology

4. **CUGR** - Academic global routing tool with network-based formulation relevant to the paper's approach

5. **Boost Graph Library** - C++ implementation of fundamental graph algorithms needed for the routing implementation

### Important Note:

The original paper (2007) predates GitHub's founding (2008). Therefore, the 15 references in the bibliography do not have direct GitHub repositories. The selected repositories above implement the **algorithmic concepts** and **methodologies** described in those references, making them valuable for anyone seeking to implement or understand the RDL routing algorithm described in this paper.
